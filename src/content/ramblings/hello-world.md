I redid my website using [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)!

## what. why.

uhhh well it was becoming a bit outdated and I thought why not redo it not like I have anything of note there

so yeah I redid my website

## The Experienceâ„¢

this is my first time using Astro so uh.
it was pretty nice it mostly did what I expected it to do  

using js/ts build-time to do static site generation is... it works and is flexible so pretty good
